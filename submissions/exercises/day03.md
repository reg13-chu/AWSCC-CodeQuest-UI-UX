Hi Everyone! For the third day of this CodeQuest this is the one that I made for this day. Above is the link to a figma file, so just click it if you want to see what I did today. For this experience I learned a new knowledge that is beneficial to me, since I am not into design back then and I am just starting to figure out more about design and user interface, and this tutorial is helpful for me to be able to have a good design in the future.
